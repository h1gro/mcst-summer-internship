My oldest friend, companion peerless!
I too blessed fate when far up north
In my retreat remote and cheerless,
Adrift in dismal snow, so fearless
Your little sleigh bell tinkled forth.

Now providential dispensation
Grant that my voice may bless, I pray,
Your soul with equal consolation,
And bear into you prison station
Of bright Lyceum days a ray!
