Adrift in dismal snow, so fearless
And bear into you prison station
Grant that my voice may bless, I pray,
In my retreat remote and cheerless,
I too blessed fate when far up north
My oldest friend, companion peerless!
Now providential dispensation
Of bright Lyceum days a ray!
Your little sleigh bell tinkled forth.
Your soul with equal consolation,
